# Add two numbers uses React + Vite 

Using Reacyt + Vite I made a code that simply adds two numbers together
the style of the page is sleek and easy to look at
I was worried about it looking like a 90s website (which isn't bad but ya know, could look better)

Anyways the web-application will be a stepping-stone for a much larger project I'm working
on and will be published later! 

Enjoy!
