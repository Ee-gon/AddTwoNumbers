# Add two numbers uses React + Vite 

Using Reacyt + Vite I made a code that simply adds two numbers together
the style of the page is sleek and easy to look at
I was worried about it looking like a 90s website (which isn't bad but ya know, could look better)

Anyways the web-application will be a stepping-stone for a much larger project I'm working
on and will be published later! 

There's a ton of side notes and other junk and stuff that are in the program
       || I don't plan on cleaning it up anytime soon so you'll have to just message me                  ||
       || if you have any questions, this web application can be used to experiment so have fun coding!  ||

Enjoy!
